    <div class="font-bold text-8xl text-white flex justify-center items-center h-44 mt-20" style="background-image: url('img2.jpg');">ABOUT US</div>
    <div class="text-4xl font-light mt-28 ml-8">About Us</div>
    <p class="font-medium text-xl mt-6 ml-8">Welcome to Helping Hands, where we believe in building a society that values inclusion, equality, and opportunity for all. Our mission is to create an environment where every individual, regardless of their background, abilities, or circumstances, can thrive and contribute to the collective progress of our community.</p>

    <div class="text-4xl font-light mt-28 ml-8">Our Mission</div>
    <p class="font-medium text-xl mt-6 ml-8">Your nonprofit mission statement is the core statement of your organization. It’s expected to be included on pages that review your nonprofit like Guidestar and something every potential donor expects to find easily. More than this, it’s the heart and soul of your organization. Your mission is a cohesive statement that explains why you exist and what you do. It should always be factored in whenever you are making serious decisions about your organization, reminding yourselves to stay true to your mission. Including this on your About Us page not only provides transparency, but also depicts the purpose of your organization to your constituents. To learn more about how to create a nonprofit mission statement, check out infographic here. </p>

    <div class="text-4xl font-light mt-28 ml-8">Our Vision</div>
    <p class="font-medium text-xl mt-6 ml-8">Our vision statement is the next step from your mission statement. This statement visually depicts the ideal state where your nonprofit has finished its work. It’s important because allowing your visitors to create a mental image of a different world is the first step to realizing that it’s possible.

        The statement itself should consist of between 5 to 25 words, depending on the complexity of your cause, and the community you’re serving. For more information on how to write a vision statement for your nonprofit, you can read our guide, or check out this list of 20 inspirational vision statements we gathered to inspire your nonprofit.</p>

    <div class="text-4xl font-light mt-28 ml-8">Our Values</div>
    <p class="font-medium text-xl mt-6 ml-8">Core Values are an important component for your nonprofit. These three to six selected values are passed along throughout your nonprofit to create a sense of cohesion among leadership and participants. Examples of values your organization could include are Integrity, Inclusion, Empowerment, or Honesty. Each of these values should be actively practiced and referred to by your organization.

        When writing the Core Values section on your About Us page, make sure to include an explanation of each value, and how it’s meant to be acted upon. Here’s a great example from the Alzheimer’s Association. 
        
        This section is generally added following the mission and vision statement, and if you decide to break up your About Us page into different segments, these three are often all featured on the same page.</p>

    <div class="text-4xl font-light mt-28 ml-8">Our Story</div>
    <p class="font-medium text-xl mt-6 ml-8">One thing I really love about nonprofit organizations is that they often are born from a place of passion, which makes your story a pivotal aspect that should be shared prominently on your About Us page. Our society and minds are driven by connecting with stories. Take the opportunity to allow visitors to relate to your journey. Talk about the challenges, the inspiration, the first steps, and how you’ve arrived where you are today. This personal touch is relatable and finishes off a page of many theoretical statements with something honest and real.

        As the story of your nonprofit is generally a little longer, include it at the end after your Mission, Vision and/or Core Values. This is a great way to tie your page together, and allow your website visitors to easily skim over your page and build interest in actually reading your story. </p>

    <div class="text-4xl font-light mt-28 ml-8">Our Leaders</div>
    <p class="font-medium text-xl mt-6 ml-8">Your leadership section should include your board of directors and your C-suite management team. Your C-suite management team should each have a biography and photo for each team member. Include their history, accomplishments, board membership, and how they have affected the organization already. Make sure to be honest, clear and professional. Extra points is you can include how they connect to your mission, or act on your organization’s core values. 

        The same can and should be included for your board of directors. Transparency, transparency, transparency. Also, If your organization has any special task-force teams, or other leadership teams that have high decision making power, make sure they are all included as well.</p>

    <div class="text-4xl font-light mt-28 ml-8">Financials</div>
    <p class="font-medium text-xl mt-6 ml-8">Many nonprofits include their finances in the About Us section. As a nonprofit, transparency with your financials is incredibly important. There are a few sections that you can include. The first is where your funds are actually going, or Use of Funds. Include in this section a brief overview of where your expenses go, how much is administrative, how much goes to your actual mission, and how much is allocated for fundraising. Do you follow the BBB Wise Giving Alliance suggested allocation of funds? You can also include a link to give.org’s review of your financials, if you have it. 

        IRS Information Returns: Form 990. Required by the IRS, all 501(c) organizations must publicly publish Form 990. Here is a great place to include these forms. Include a full history of your 990s from each year. More information can be found here. 
        
        Lastly, if your organization has yearly audits, it’s great to post these as well. These show constituents detailed information about where your money is actually going. This is always helpful to build trust with your audience. </p>
